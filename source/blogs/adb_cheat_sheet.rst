adb over wifi
-------------
we can use adb over wifi or specifically with a tcp connection. To use adb over wifi, first connect the phone via usb and enable usb debug. then list all device::

    adb devices

this should give a output like this::

    device_id    device

now check the ip of the android device with::

    adb shell ifconfig

output::

    wlan0     Link encap:UNSPEC    Driver icnss
              inet addr:XXX.XXX.X.XX  Bcast:XXX.XXX.X.XXX

take note of the ip address after ``inet addr``. we will need it later. now restart tcpip at some port with::

    adb tcpip $port
    
for example 5555::

    adb tcpip 5555

you can disconnect the use now. to connect to the device now just give the following command::

    adb connect $ip:$port

like::

    adb connect 192.168.1.4:5555

source: `How can I connect to Android with ADB over TCP? <https://stackoverflow.com/a/58334911/5350059>`_

-----------------
to take a screenshot::

    adb exec-out screencap -p > screen.png

https://stackoverflow.com/a/37191719/5350059

or save it in phone then pull::

    adb shell /system/bin/screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png
    adb pull /sdcard/screenshot.png screenshot.png

source: `which commands line are used to take a screenshot on android device (except screencap) <https://stackoverflow.com/a/32883890/5350059>`_

change setting with adb
-----------------------
changes are divided into 3 namespace: system, secure, global. we can `get`, `put`, `delete` individual keys and `list` all in a namespace. to `list` all in system::

    adb shell settings --user 0 list system

`get`, `put` and `delete` the same::

    adb shell settings --user 0 get $namespace $key
    adb shell settings --user 0 put $namespace $key $value
    adb shell settings --user 0 delete $namespace $key

source: `adb command to open settings and change them <https://stackoverflow.com/a/53319647/5350059>`_

limit the number of connected devices in hotspot
------------------------------------------------
::

    adb shell settings --user 0 put system hotspot_max_station_num $num # num=0-6 where 0 is unlimited
