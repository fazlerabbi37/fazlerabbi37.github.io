see log of a package

    adb shell "logcat --pid=$(pidof -s <package_name>)"


adb over wifi
-------------
we can use adb over wifi or specifically with a tcp connection [12]_ .to use adb over wifi, first connect the phone via usb and enable usb debug. then list all device::

    adb devices

this should give a output like this::

    device_name    some_number

now check the ip of the android device with::

    adb shell ifconfig

output::

    wlan0     Link encap:UNSPEC    Driver icnss
              inet addr:XXX.XXX.X.XX  Bcast:XXX.XXX.X.XXX

take note of the ip address after ``inet addr``. we will need it later. now restart tcpip at some port with::

    adb tcpip $port
    
for example 5555::

    adb tcpip 5555

you can disconnect the use now. to connect to the device now just give the following command::

    adb connect $ip:$port

like::

    adb connect 192.168.1.4:5555
