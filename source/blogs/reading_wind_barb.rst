Reading Wind Barb
=================
Reading wind barb to determine the speed and direction of wind.

Created on: 2019-11-19

Bit background story first. I use an open source app named `Forecastie <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/cz.martykan.forecastie/>`_ to see weather updates. It's a very straight forward app which shows us the weather update of a city using `OpenWeatheMap <https://openweathermap.org/>`_ API. Along with many other information it also shows the wind data with a number indicating the speed in meter par second and a arrow showing direction. I had no idea what the arrow maned as it would point different direction at different time. I wanted to know and started searching.
